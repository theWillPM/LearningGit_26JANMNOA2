___
This is the base text for our GitHub practice potato.
Each student will bake one small edit to improve the charity or correctness of this text.
The goal is to practice working with tree branches pull requests and asynchronous communication.
Some sentences may have extra words or missing punctuation or grammar that doesnt quite mark sense.
Students should only make the change that was revealed to them so that we can review each pull request carefully and avoid unnecessary Marge conflicts.
When everyone has finished their edits the class will have a cleaner clearer and more nail-polished version of this text.
